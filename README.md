IBM Think2020 IoT Lab - Hyper Localized Weather and Crop prediction using Watson

Hyper Localized Weather and Crop Predictions Using IBM Watson ,IoT, Sensors and Personal Weather Stations/TWC API's [1239]
Markus van Kempen, Executive Architect and VC, IBM

In this lab, attendees will use a the Raspberry Pi, some temperature sensors and a camera, which will be connected to IBM Watson IoT Platform. Using Node-RED and the Watson IoT Platform, you will integrate the resulting data into Weather Underground. You will create a model with historic data and live sensor data, using Watson Studio to predict the weather conditions for tomorrow. You also will feed the camera image into Watson Visual Recognition to analyze the weather as well. You will also enhance the prediction models with "vegetables" attributes to forecast which vegetable would grow best in a hypothetical garden 3-6 months from now.

Note: The lab maybe changed slidly form the orginal scope due to the current situation 

Please follow the setup instructions.
