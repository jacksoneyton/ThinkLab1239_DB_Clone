Hyper-Localized Weather and Crop Predictions Using IBM Watson, IoT, Sensors and Personal Weather Stations/TWC API's [1239]
Markus van Kempen, Executive Architect and VC, IBM

In this lab, attendees will use a Raspberry Pi, temperature sensors and a camera, all connected to IBM Watson IoT Platform. Using Node-RED and the Watson IoT Platform, you will integrate the resulting data into Weather Underground. You will create a model with historic data and live sensor data using Watson Studio to predict the weather conditions for tomorrow. You also will feed the camera image into Watson Visual Recognition to analyze the weather. Prediction models will be enhanced with "vegetable" attributes to forecast which vegetable would grow best in a hypothetical garden 3-6 months in the future.

Note: Because of the current situation some elements of the Lab might be changed slightly from the orginal scope to accommodate online learning.

Please follow the setup instructions.
